# 5 Other supplments

I don't know how to crack the products fo `JetBrains`, and just collect the resources on the Internet for you to use. I hope you can support the genuine version if you have the conditions.

In addition, the latest patch to activate version `2020.2` still uses `zhele`'s patch, which will take effect until 2089. But the activation method is different from the previous one, with adding installtion parameters during the installation. According to the current situation, `Zhele` does not seem to update the patch. Therefore, the activation method is likely to be invalid in version `2020.3` or later version. Please note that.
